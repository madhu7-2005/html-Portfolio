<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a quick learner, especially when I find myself genuinely interested in the process behind the work I’m doing. I believe curiosity drives me to pick up new skills and adapt quickly. Outside of work and academics, I’m passionate about sports and music. I’ve actively played Badminton for years and have won several local tournaments — it’s a sport that keeps me happy and energized. I also enjoy a good game of chess. When it comes to music, I’m a huge fan of vibey Bollywood tracks, and Punjabi songs in particular always lift my mood with their infectious energy.</p>
